            This is Hafed omar from libya student. Website welcome pages are
            typically more prevalent at personal websites, portfolios, and
            traditional businesses. They are less popular on news websites
            (where the headline story acts as the introduction). Of course,
            welcome areas aren’t considered necessary on sites with a clear
            purpose and established audience – there would be no point having a
            welcome page at CNN.com, as their user base most likely already
            knows who they are. :)
