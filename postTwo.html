            Website welcome pages are typically more prevalent at personal

            popular on news websites (where the headline story acts as the
            introduction). Of course, welcome areas aren’t considered necessary
            on sites with a clear purpose and established audience – there would
            be no point having a welcome page at CNN.com, as their user base
            most likely already knows who they are. :)
